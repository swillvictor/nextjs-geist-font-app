# Detailed Implementation Plan

---

## Overview

This plan details the implementation of a modern, responsive, multi-page website. All pages (landing, about, services, products, blog, contact, login, and dashboard) will share a consistent header, footer, and styling. The JavaScript files will handle interactive behaviors and form validations, with robust error handling throughout. Every change follows best practices for accessibility (e.g., semantic HTML, ARIA roles, descriptive alt texts) and includes graceful error handlers (e.g., for image load failures).

- **Image Placeholder:**  
  - Use a placeholder image:  
    ```html
    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400?text=Product+image+display+detailed+view" alt="Detailed view of the product image in a modern product template" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='fallback.jpg';" />
    ```
- **UI Components:**  
  - Ensure buttons and product details are styled using the CSS framework defined in styles.css.

#### blog/index.html (Blog List)

- **Navigation:**  
  - Each card links to blog/post-template.html.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Use CSS grid/flexbox for adaptable layout on different devices.

#### blog/post-template.html (Blog Post Detail)

  - Integrate client-side validation from js/form-validation.js.
- **UI Clarity:**  
  - Use clear labels, ample spacing, and modern input styles.
  
#### login.html
- **Login Form:**  
  - Create a simple login form with fields for username/email and password.
- **Validation:**

### js/main.js
- **Global Interactions:**  
  - Implement mobile navigation toggle for the header.
  - Add scroll event listeners to modify the header appearance on scroll.

  - Wrap dynamic code in try-catch blocks and log errors to the console.
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Use template literals for dynamic content and ensure code modularity.

### js/form-validation.js
- **Form Validation Logic:**  
  - Attach event listeners to the forms in contact.html and login.html.
  - Validate required fields (e.g., ensuring non-empty inputs, proper email format).
  - Use regular expressions where applicable and display error messages adjacent to the affected fields.
- **User Feedback:**  
  - Dynamically update the DOM to show validation errors using accessible elements.
- **Code Structure:**  
  - Use clear function names and comments for maintainability.

## 4. Assets and Dependency Management

### Assets (assets/images and assets/fonts)
- **Images:**  
  - Ensure that any site-specific images residing in assets are preserved. New image elements will use placeholders only when explicitly required.
- **Fonts:**  
  - Load custom fonts from assets/fonts if needed and include fallback web-safe fonts in CSS.

## 5. Error Handling & Best Practices

- **HTML:**  
  - Every `<img>` tag includes an `onerror` attribute to handle load failures gracefully.
  - Semantic HTML tags improve accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS:**  
  - Utilize responsive design principles and media queries to ensure proper layout on all devices.
  - Use CSS variables for scalable theming.
- **JavaScript:**  
  - Implement try-catch blocks around interactive functions.
  - Gracefully handle missing form elements or other runtime issues.
- **Testing & Validation:**  
  - Validate forms using both client-side JavaScript and manual browser testing.
  - Test on multiple device sizes to ensure responsive design.
